# IAM Section

#####Users & Groups
- IAM = Identity and Access Management, Global service
- Root account created by default, shouldn’t be used or shared
- Users are people within your organization, and can be grouped
- Groups only contain users, not other groups
- Users don’t have to belong to a group, and user can belong to multiple groups

##### Permissions
- Users or Groups can be assigned JSON documents called policies
- These policies define the permissions of the users
- In AWS you apply the least privilege principle: don’t give more permissions than a user needs
